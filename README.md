### PROJECT OBJECTIVE
To develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the risk of heart disease, utilizing advanced data analysis and predictive techniques to aid in early diagnosis and prevention.
### IMPORTANCE OF PREDICTING HEART DISEASE RISK
1. Predictive models can help reduce mortality rates by enabling early diagnosis and treatment.
2. Early identification of individuals at high risk allows for timely intervention and lifestyle modifications that can prevent the onset of heart disease.
3. Continuous analysis and refinement of predictive models contribute to the growing body of knowledge in cardiovascular health and disease prevention.
4. By identifying high-risk populations, targeted education and awareness campaigns can be conducted to promote heart health and preventive measures.

### RISK FACTORS LEADING TO CHRONIC HEART DISEASE
- Elevated cholesterol levels
- Pre-existing congenital heart disease
- Existence of diabetes in an individual.
- Hypertension
- Obesity
- Sedentary life
- Smoking
- Unhealthy diet

### RECOMMENDATIONS
- Implement robust data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, improving the reliability of the model.
- Conduct thorough feature selection and engineering to identify and create the most relevant features that impact heart disease risk.
- Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability across different subsets of data.
- Ensure that data is collected from diverse sources, including electronic health records, wearable devices, and patient surveys, to capture a wide range of variables.
